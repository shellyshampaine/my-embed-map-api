A project "Go & Help" for Technovation Girls 2020 international competition for school students. The goal of the project was to develop an app connecting people who needed help 
(eg. disabled or elderly) with volunteers via mobile app. This script is sending a request to the Google maps API. Based on the response the route is calculated and 
displayed in a mobile app prototype developed in Thunkable.
